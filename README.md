# dotvim

My vim files, boring as they are. Aiming to be the simplest dotvim on earth.


# Installation

Clear out everything dear to you e.g. `.vim`, `.vimrc`, `.gvimrc`

Run `make; make install`

Open vim and run :PluginInstall

Note: make sure to set your fonts accordingly with the powerline crap in your terminal!
